            <p>Hi, I'm Anjola! &#128075;</p>

            <p>
                I currently work as a Marking Assistant at the University of Alberta. I grew up creating—or rather, trying to create—games on Roblox. 
                I was that kid with a dream to build the kind of games I always wanted to play. That dream is what first sparked my love for coding, 
                and eventually led me to study it in university.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                While at university, I fell in love with the more theoretical side of computer science. 
                I became fascinated by how programming languages work, the challenge of parallelizing algorithms, and research in general. 
                That curiosity led me to pursue a directed study, through which I was honored to receive the 
                <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/en/augustana/about-us/advantage/teaching-and-learning/learning-awards/outstanding.html">
                    Outstanding Undergraduate Research Award
                </a> in my final year.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since graduating, I’ve been exploring creative projects that bring me back to what made me fall in love with coding in the first place—
                while still pushing me to learn and grow within the field.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Outside of tech, I’m a fitness enthusiast, a lifelong Arsenal supporter, and of course, a gamer at heart. 
                I love cozy games like Harvest Moon, Story of Seasons, and Animal Crossing, and more realistic games like The Sims 4 and PUBG. 
                My fascination with first-person shooters is a bit unexpected, but I’m always down for a good match.

                    During my Hardware Practicum, I demonstrated strong problem-solving and critical-thinking skills by diagnosing and 
                    resolving a variety of computer issues. With keen attention to detail, I disassembled and reassembled computers, ensuring 
                    proper functionality while preventing damage. My responsibilities included replacing SSDs, backing up and restoring data, 
                    installing new Windows versions and updates, and configuring essential drivers. I also troubleshot hardware and software issues, 
                    installed security software to prevent malware infections, and performed virus removal and system cleanups to optimize performance.

                    Additionally, I built two computers from scratch using parts available in the store. This involved carefully installing the CPU onto 
                    the motherboard, inserting RAM, connecting power supply cables, attaching fans, and ensuring all components were properly secured. 
                    After assembling the hardware, I installed Windows on the newly built systems, ensuring they were fully operational and ready for 
                    sale to customers.
