            <p>
                Coding, to me, is as much an art form as it is a science. Having always been a creative soul with a fondness for 
                painting and drawing, I've found Computing Science to be the perfect fusion of my analytical and artistic talents. 
                It's here that I can craft projects that not only showcase my skills but also ignite the spark of innovation.

                I create coding projects that mix my analytical / problem solving skills, as well as my design and artistic skills.
                From creating personal portfolios to constructing game frameworks, I focus on projects that not only provide me personal enjoyment,
                but that could pteontially make an impact in the future.
            </p>

            <p>
                Other than coding, I'm a fitness enthustiant and enjoy watching football-not the American kind! I also enjoy playing games, especially cozy
                games like Harvest Moon, Story of Seasons and Animal Crossing. I also enjoy the Sims 4 and weirdly PUGB. My fascincation for first-person shooter
                games is quite interesting indeed...

                        I evaluate and grade student assignments, ensuring fair and consistent assessment based on course criteria. 
                        This role requires strong attention to detail, critical thinking, and adherence to academic standards to provide 
                        accurate feedback that supports student learning.

                    <p>
                        During my Hardware Practicum, I demonstrated strong problem-solving and critical-thinking skills by diagnosing and 
                        resolving a variety of computer issues. With keen attention to detail, I disassembled and reassembled computers, ensuring 
                        proper functionality while preventing damage. My responsibilities included replacing SSDs, backing up and restoring data, 
                        installing new Windows versions and updates, and configuring essential drivers. I also troubleshot hardware and software issues, 
                        installed security software to prevent malware infections, and performed virus removal and system cleanups to optimize performance.

                        Additionally, I built two computers from scratch using parts available in the store. This involved carefully installing the CPU onto 
                        the motherboard, inserting RAM, connecting power supply cables, attaching fans, and ensuring all components were properly secured. 
                        After assembling the hardware, I installed Windows on the newly built systems, ensuring they were fully operational and ready for 
                        sale to customers.

                        As a Junior Software Developer at Areto Labs, I developed a Python-based YouTube data scraper that processed comments and replies, 
                        and ran periodically via an API endpoint. I also contributed to the backend development of the social media moderation SaaS platform 
                        by designing and optimizing SQL queries, building REST API endpoints, and implementing automated moderation workflows. I wrote unit tests 
                        for database operations and integration tests for API endpoints. Additionally, I implemented a Google Cloud uptime monitoring system and 
                        worked with Docker for testing, while collaborating in an Agile environment to enhance platform functionality.

                        As a Teaching Assistant for a first-year Python programming course, I provided technical support and guidance to students, 
                        leveraging advanced Python expertise to help them complete lab work and assignments. I fostered a supportive learning environment 
                        by mentoring students, enhancing their problem-solving skills, and strengthening their coding knowledge. This role required effective 
                        communication, leadership, and the ability to simplify complex concepts to ensure student success.

                        In this role, I was responsible for bridging machine learning models and user-facing applications by building a general machine learning 
                        interface in Python using Streamlit. I created a middleware functionality to preprocess user inputs into numerical formats for the model, 
                        retrieve predictions and scores, and present them on a user-friendly front end. I also customized the dashboard to provide clear, 
                        interactive visualizations, making it easy for end users to interpret positive and negative sentiment results. This required integrating 
                        modular designs and prioritizing accessibility while collaborating with the research team to refine the interface.
