            <h2>My Background</h2>

            <p>
                Coding, to me, is as much an art form as it is a science. Having always been a creative soul with a fondness for 
                painting and drawing, I've found Computing Science to be the perfect fusion of my analytical and artistic talents. 
                It's here that I can craft projects that not only showcase my skills but also ignite the spark of innovation.

                I create coding projects that mix my analytical / problem solving skills, as well as my design and artistic skills.
                From creating personal portfolios to constructing game frameworks, I focus on projects that not only provide me personal enjoyment,
                but that could pteontially make an impact in the future.
            </p>

            <p>
                Other than coding, I'm a fitness enthustiant and enjoy watching football-not the American kind! I also enjoy playing games, especially cozy
                games like Harvest Moon, Story of Seasons and Animal Crossing. I also enjoy the Sims 4 and weirdly PUGB. My fascincation for first-person shooter
                games is quite interesting indeed...

                    I evaluate and grade student assignments, ensuring fair and consistent assessment based on course criteria. 
                    This role requires strong attention to detail, critical thinking, and adherence to academic standards to provide

                    During my Hardware Practicum, I demonstrated strong problem-solving and critical-thinking skills by diagnosing and 
                    resolving a variety of computer issues. With keen attention to detail, I disassembled and reassembled computers, ensuring 
                    proper functionality while preventing damage. My responsibilities included replacing SSDs, backing up and restoring data, 
                    installing new Windows versions and updates, and configuring essential drivers. I also troubleshot hardware and software issues, 
                    installed security software to prevent malware infections, and performed virus removal and system cleanups to optimize performance.

                    Additionally, I built two computers from scratch using parts available in the store. This involved carefully installing the CPU onto 
                    the motherboard, inserting RAM, connecting power supply cables, attaching fans, and ensuring all components were properly secured. 
                    After assembling the hardware, I installed Windows on the newly built systems, ensuring they were fully operational and ready for 
                    sale to customers.

                    by designing and optimizing SQL queries, building REST API endpoints, and implementing automated moderation workflows. I wrote unit tests 
                    for database operations and integration tests for API endpoints. Additionally, I implemented a Google Cloud uptime monitoring system and 
                    worked with Docker for testing, while collaborating in an Agile environment to enhance platform functionality.
