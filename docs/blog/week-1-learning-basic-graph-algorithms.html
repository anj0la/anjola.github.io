                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    This week was my first week into my 4-month study plan to address my weak points in data structures and algorithms. Each month, I take notes and practice questions on the topics that I struggle the most with. This way, I'll be able to increase my fundamental knowledge of these data structures and algorithms, and do better on online coding assessments and interviews.
                </p>
                
                <h2>My Progress</h2>
                <p>
                    I keep track of what I've done weekly using Trello, and you can view my <a href="https://trello.com/b/pdaK7x8T/interview-preparation" style="text-decoration:underline;">Trello board</a> here to see my progress!
                </p>
                <p>
                    So far, I've been able to implement:
                </p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                    <li>DFS (recursively and with a stack)</li>
                    <li>BFS</li>
                    <li>Topological Sort</li>
                    <li>Khan's Algorithm</li>
                    <li>Connected Components</li>
                    <li>Union Find</li>
                    <li>Cycle Detection</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    My knowledge of these algorithms has already increased just by setting aside 4 hours a day from Monday to Friday to dive deeper into these topics. Over the weekend, I plan to solidify and test my knowledge by practicing graph and tree-related problems on LeetCode and/or HackerRank.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Reflections</h2>
                <p>
                    It's awesome to see how much I've learned by being consistent. LeetCode can be difficult at times, because some of the questions come easy to me, while others I struggle with. I'm happy though that I've gotten to a point where the Easy questions are relatively easy for me, and that Medium questions aren't as challenging as they were before. I still struggle with Hard questions, but as I continue to solidify my understanding and practice, things will get easier.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm excited to see how much I'll have grown by the end of August, and hopefully, I'll have finally finished the Top 150 list that I started in January.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'll see you next week!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Until then,
                </p>
